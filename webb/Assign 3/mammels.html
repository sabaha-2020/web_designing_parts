        <p>Mammals (from Latin mamma 'breast') are a group of vertebrate animals constituting the class Mammalia (/məˈmeɪli.ə/), 
          characterized by the presence of mammary glands which in females produce milk for feeding (nursing) their young, 
          a neocortex (a region of the brain), fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. 
          These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles (including birds) from which they diverged in the Carboniferous, 
          over 300 million years ago. Around 6,400 extant species of mammals have been described divided into 29 orders. The largest orders, 
          in terms of number of species, are the rodents, bats, and Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, moles, shrews, and others). 
          The next three are the Primates (including humans, apes, monkeys, and others), the Artiodactyla (cetaceans and even-toed ungulates), 
          and the Carnivora (cats, dogs, seals, and others).</p>

                Symphysodon, colloquially known as discus, is a genus of cichlids native to the Amazon river basin in South America. 
                Due to their distinctive shape, behavior, and bright colors and patterns, discus are popular as freshwater aquarium fish, 
                and their aquaculture in several countries in Asia is a major industry.They are sometimes referred to as pompadour fish.
                The discus fish has attracted a cult following of collectors and has created a multimillion dollar international industry complete with shows, 
                competitions, and reputed online breeders[citation needed].

                Hornbills (Bucerotidae) are a family of bird found in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and Melanesia. 
                They are characterized by a long, down-curved bill which is frequently brightly coloured and sometimes has a casque on the upper mandible. 
                Both the common English and the scientific name of the family refer to the shape of the bill, "buceros" being "cow horn" in Greek. Hornbills have a two-lobed kidney. They are the only birds in which the first and second neck vertebrae (the atlas and axis respectively) are fused together; this probably provides a more stable platform for carrying the bill.[1] The family is omnivorous, feeding on fruit and small animals. They are monogamous breeders nesting in natural cavities in trees and sometimes cliffs. A number of mainly insular species of hornbill with small ranges are threatened with extinction, 
                namely in Southeast Asia.

                Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 7,000 species,[1] ranging across all continents except Antarctica, 
                as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic since it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia although some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.
                Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as "legless lizards"), 
                have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide. 
                They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with brightly colours, 
                to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; 
                many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.

                The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is a species of venomous elapid snake endemic to jungles in Southern and Southeast Asia. 
                The sole member of the genus Ophiophagus, it is distinguishable from other cobras, most noticeably by its size and neck patterns. 
                The king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake, with an average length of 3.18 to 4 m (10.4 to 13.1 ft), reaching a maximum of 5.85 m (19.2 ft).
                Its skin colour varies across the habitats, from black with white stripes to unbroken brownish grey. It preys chiefly on other snakes, 
                including its own species. Unlike other snakes, it rarely hunts other vertebrates, such as rodents and lizards.

                Tortoises are reptiles of the family Testudinidae of the order Testudines (Latin: tortoise). Like other turtles, tortoises have a shell to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder Cryptodira, 
                they retract their necks and heads directly backward into the shell to protect them.
                Tortoises can vary in size with some species, such as the Galápagos giant tortoise, growing to more than 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) in length, whereas others like the Speckled cape tortoise have shells that measure only 6.8 centimetres (2.7 in) long.[1] Several lineages of tortoises have independently evolved very large body sizes in excess of 100 kg, including the Galapagos giant tortoise and the Aldabra giant tortoise.

                The green anole is a small to medium-sized lizard, with a slender body. 
                The head is long and pointed with ridges between the eyes and nostrils, 
                and smaller ones on the top of the head. The toes have adhesive pads to facilitate climbing. 
                They exhibit sexual dimorphism, the males being fifteen percent larger. 
                Adult males within a population can be classified within a heavyweight and a lightweight morph. 
                The male dewlap (throat fan) is three times the size of the female's and bright orange to pink, 
                whereas that of the female is lighter in color. The dewlap is usually pink for Anolis carolinensis 
                (more orange-red in A. sagrei) and is very rarely present in females. 
                The color of the dewlap is variable and different from the lizard eye to the human eye.

                It should not be confused with the scarlet snake (Cemophora coccinea) or scarlet kingsnake (Lampropeltis elapsoides), 
                which are harmless mimics. No subspecies are currently recognized.

                The green iguana (Iguana iguana), also known as the American iguana or the common green iguana, is a large, arboreal, 
                mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus Iguana. Usually, this animal is simply called the iguana. 
                The green iguana ranges over a large geographic area; it is native from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico, 
                and has been introduced from South America to Puerto Rico and is very common throughout the island, 
                where it is colloquially known as gallina de palo ("bamboo chicken" or "chicken of the tree") and considered an invasive species; 
                in the United States, feral populations also exist in South Florida (including the Florida Keys), Hawaii, the U.S. 
                Virgin Islands and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.[6][7] Green iguanas have also successfully colonised the island of Anguilla, 
                arriving on the island in 1995 after rafting across the Caribbean from Guadeloupe, where they were introduced.

                Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015. 
                The members of this family are best known for their distinct range of colors, being capable of shifting to different hues and degrees of brightness. The large number of species in the family exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to change color. For some, it is more of a shift of brightness (shades of brown); for others, 
                a plethora of color-combinations (reds, yellows, greens, blues) can be seen.

                Pogona is a genus of reptiles containing six lizard species which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. 
                The name "bearded dragon" refers to the underside of the throat (or "beard") of the lizard, 
                which can turn black and gain weight for a number of reasons, most often as a result of stress, or if they feel threatened.
                They are a semi-arboreal species, spending significant amounts of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. 
                Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. Their diet consists primarily of insects, vegetation, and occasionally small rodents. They are found throughout much of Australia and inhabit a wide range of environments, 
                such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands.
